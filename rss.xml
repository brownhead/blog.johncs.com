            <title>Principles of Building a Simple Site</title>
            <link>http://johncs.com/posts/building-websites.htm</link>
            <description>

            <description>
Last week a mysterious double-sided puzzle appeared next to the kitchen at <a class="reference external" href="https://www.khanacademy.org/">Khan Academy</a>.

            <title>Typos in search queries at Khan Academy</title>
            <link>http://johncs.com/posts/spellchecker.htm</link>
            <description>
One year ago, searching for <em>polinomials</em> on <a class="reference external" href="https://www.khanacademy.org/search">Khan Academy's search page</a> would give you no results. If you typed the same thing into Google you'd be efficiently and politely corrected.

            <title>Local Storage Today</title>
            <link>http://johncs.com/posts/6-localstorage.htm</link>
            <description>
I'd like to write to <tt class="docutils literal">localStorage</tt> often. I'd also like to write to it synchronously in response to user interaction. Past wisdom says this is a bad idea and will give me Angry Users Syndrome very quickly.

            <title>Intelligently Shortening Text</title>
            <link>http://johncs.com/posts/5-highlighting.htm</link>
            <description>
Our search page at Khan Academy displays highlighting information to provide context for our results. Our full-text search engine gives us the highlighting text, but it doesn't provide a way to reliably control the length of the text. The end result can be undesirable.

            <title>The Python Import System</title>
            <link>http://johncs.com/posts/4-python-import.htm</link>
            <description>
I made a presentation at Khan Academy on a few good things to know about Python's import system. Here's a writeup of that presentation (this is written mostly as a reference, sorry for the dryness).

            <title>Transactions with Python's sqlite3 Package</title>
            <link>http://johncs.com/posts/1-sqlite3_transactions.htm</link>
            <description>
Python's <tt class="docutils literal">sqlite3</tt> package tries to take care of the tricky business of properly executing <tt class="docutils literal">BEGIN</tt> and <tt class="docutils literal">COMMIT</tt> statements. The rules of when and how this automatic transactioning is done has confounded a number of developers, many of whom have jumped ship and chosen to use the <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/rogerbinns/apsw">aspw</a> package or similar.
