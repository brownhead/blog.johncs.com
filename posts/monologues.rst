    A (natural?) evolution to the idea of keeping a "coding journal" that I've taken into my workflow.

`I <https://github.com/brownhead/phial/issues/1>`_ `talk <https://github.com/brownhead/mangoengine/issues/7>`_ `to <https://github.com/brownhead/superzippy/issues/11>`_ `myself <https://github.com/brownhead/mangoengine/issues/2>`_ `on <https://github.com/galah-group/galah/issues/399>`_ `GitHub <https://github.com/acm-ucr/hub/issues/8>`_ `a <https://github.com/galah-group/galah/issues/393>`_ `lot <https://github.com/Khan/engblog/issues/21>`_. If I could share our internal issues at `Khan Academy <https://www.khanacademy.org>`_ you'd see a similar story there. I do this to serve a few ends:

1. I want to share my progress on a task.
2. I want people to give me input on the decisions I'm making.
3. I want to easily pause a task and come back to it later.
4. I want all the `rubber ducks <http://www.rubberduckdebugging.com/>`_.

I initially started doing this (back in college) solely for the third benefit of being able to easily pause and resume tasks. I basically wanted a coding journal [#coding_journals]_, and it was only a matter of convenience that I used GitHub issues over some random file on my computer.

Eventually, after several ever-so-slightly-awkward conversations where someone thanked me for talking to myself, I realized I'd stumbled on a pretty sweet communication tool. Since communication is generally hard, I was pumped to grow my tool-belt.

I've kept up the monologues ever since I started, and now at Khan Academy it nearly always comes up in my project retrospectives as being super useful [#project_retrospectives]_. It's definitely a vital part of my workflow now.

Though I'm suspicious that my comments are slowly getting spammier (a recent one: "Hmm, I think I'll go get a sandwich and then try this again"), but so far nobody has minded :).

.. [#coding_journals] A `blog post <http://tburette.github.io/blog/2014/06/25/the-power-of-keeping-a-coding-journal/>`_ written awhile ago talks about how useful coding journals generally are.
.. [#project_retrospectives] At Khan Academy, after every project (which are always 2-4 weeks), everyone involved meets to give feedback to each other and discuss how things went.
