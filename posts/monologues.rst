`Sometimes <https://github.com/galah-group/galah/issues/393>`_ `I <https://github.com/brownhead/phial/issues/1>`_ `talk <https://github.com/brownhead/mangoengine/issues/7>`_ `to <https://github.com/brownhead/superzippy/issues/11>`_ `myself <https://github.com/brownhead/mangoengine/issues/2>`_ `on <https://github.com/galah-group/galah/issues/399>`_ `GitHub <https://github.com/acm-ucr/hub/issues/8>`_. I don't do this because talking to myself is super fun, that's just a plus. I do it as a way to communicate with others (including future me).

This work flow is like keeping a public coding journal. A `blog post <http://tburette.github.io/blog/2014/06/25/the-power-of-keeping-a-coding-journal/>`_ that got some attention awhile ago talks about how useful private coding journals are because they let you quickly context switch to projects you haven't touched in months. But if you go one step farther and make your journal public like I've done by spilling my thoughts into trackers, you get some extra wins:

* Interested people can see your detailed progress on what you're doing.
* Coworkers (and future you) can find out why you made certain decisions.
* Mentors can know when you're going down a bad route and nudge you in a better direction.
* All this communication happens asynchronously, without anyone being bothered.

Many people (at least 8) have told me that this part of my work flow has been helpful to them.
