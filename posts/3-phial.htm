<p>I have a few static websites currently under my care. I manage one with <a class="reference external" href="http://jekyllrb.com">Jekyll</a>, another without a static site generator (just raw HTML files), and another (this blog) with a new tool I created named <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/brownhead/phial">Phial</a>.</p>
<div class="section" id="why-not-just-use">
<h2>Why Not Just Use...</h2>
<p>Like many others, I was wooed by the glory of <a class="reference external" href="http://jekyllrb.com">Jekyll</a> when it arrived. It was the first SSG I had run across and it sounded perfect compared to hosting a heavy backend to serve a simple website. However, after using Jekyll to deploy a few websites, I don't want to continue using it.</p>
<p>I want to build my static sites in a way that is similar to how I build my dynamic sites. I don't want to have a tool magically plug everything into the right spot and generate the site for me. <strong>I want to build the tool</strong>. Given the <a class="reference external" href="http://staticsitegenerators.net/">amazingly large number of SSG's out there</a>, I don't think I'm alone.</p>
<p>So I set out to create a framework that would allow you to make such a tool.</p>

<div class="section" id="philosophy-behind-phial">
<h2>Philosophy Behind Phial</h2>
<p>I want creating a site with Phial to feel very much like creating a site with <a class="reference external" href="http://flask.pocoo.org/">Flask</a>. I've always had a lot of fun working with Flask, and I want Phial to be fun as well.</p>
<p>Take a look at the Flask's &quot;Hello World!&quot; application available on their home page:</p>
<pre class="code python literal-block">
<span class="kn">from</span> <span class="nn">flask</span> <span class="kn">import</span> <span class="n">Flask</span>
<span class="n">app</span> <span>=</span> <span class="n">Flask</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">__name__</span><span class="p">)</span>

<span class="nd">&#64;app.route</span><span class="p">(</span><span>&quot;/&quot;</span><span class="p">)</span>
<span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">hello</span><span class="p">():</span>
    <span class="k">return</span> <span>&quot;Hello World!&quot;</span>

<span class="k">if</span> <span class="n">__name__</span> <span>==</span> <span>&quot;__main__&quot;</span><span class="p">:</span>
    <span class="n">app</span><span>.</span><span class="n">run</span><span class="p">()</span>
</pre>
<p>The corresponding application with Phial looks like:</p>
<pre class="code python literal-block">
<span class="kn">from</span> <span class="nn">phial</span> <span class="kn">import</span> <span class="n">page</span>

<span class="nd">&#64;page</span><span class="p">(</span><span>&quot;index.htm&quot;</span><span class="p">)</span>
<span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">hello</span><span class="p">():</span>
    <span class="k">return</span> <span>&quot;Hello World!&quot;</span>
</pre>
<p>The desire to keep things as simple and straightforward as possible helped me design Phial, and I'm pretty happy with the result. More examples and such can be found on <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/brownhead/phial">Phial's GitHub page</a> if you're interested.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="state-of-phial">
<h2>State of Phial</h2>
<p>Right now, I'm very happy with Phial and how it is performing. I'm planning on converting all my static sites to use it.</p>
<p>After I'm personally as happy as can be with its performance (to the extent that one can be happy with their own software) I will start writing extensive documentation and examples. After that I will start trying to spread the glory of Phial to everyone.</p>
