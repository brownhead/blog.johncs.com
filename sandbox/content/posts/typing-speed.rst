    When I switched from a standard keyboard to an ErgoDox I learned something about how I program.

A year ago I switched to an `ErgoDox <http://ergodox.org/>`_, which has a slightly different layout from a traditional keyboard.

The transition was rough and it took months to get back to full speed. During this time, instead of quickly spilling out code and iterating on it over and over again, I was thinking very carefully about what I wanted and only then typing it up.

It felt a little like working on a big C++ application with a long build step. Each change demanding extreme thought to keep the amount of time compiling low, lest I get bored.

I figured the change of style might improve my productivity. I've heard the best programmers spend most of their time thinking and only a tiny amount writing code.

This seems like an adage that depends on your workflow though. I was working on a Python application in the style of `Test Driven Development <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test-driven_development>`_. This should have made development feel very quick and let me see my changes fail or succeed instantly. Instead it just felt gruelingly slow.
