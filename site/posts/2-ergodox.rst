I joined `a group buy on Massdrop <https://www.massdrop.com/buy/ergodox>`_ some time ago. After some anxious waiting and clumsy soldering I had my very own `ErgoDox keyboard <http://ergodox.org/>`_ to play with.

I've been using it as my primary keyboard for about a month now and I'm very pleased. It performs as well as any other mechanical keyboard I've used, and there are a couple of things that make it stand out in one way or another: its efficiency and its consistent problems.

Efficiency
----------

Being able to change my layout around has been immensely helpful. I've remapped many of the punctuation characters and moved keys around to fit my preferences like you'd expect, but I've also added a vim-like layer to my keyboard.

When I hold down a special key the whole keyboard changes. My left hand's home row is suddenly filled with modifier keys, while my right hand's home row is filled with arrow keys (vim-style) and the rest of the keys around my right hand turn into other handy navigational keys. I've essentially turned my entire computer into vim, and I love it.

Problems
--------

I'm not loving the Cherry MX Clear key switches I installed though. They're very stiff and can make my little fingers pretty tired, especially when typing quickly. Further, I've noticed some of my modifier keys (most notably control) aren't registering when they're pressed. Because of this, a few times a day when I go to copy and paste something I find that I didn't actually copy anything. Further, I borrowed the tools I used to assemble the keyboard so if I want to debug anything I either need to borrow a multimeter again (and then potentially the rest of the equipment) or buy my own gear.

I've also been forced to remove the functionality from a number of the keys because they were too difficult to reach. Most notably the four smaller keys in both thumbwells are mostly unused (a couple of them are the much-neglected GUI keys). Given that my nickname could be `monster hands <http://archer.wikia.com/wiki/Lana_Kane>`_ I don't know who is actually comfortable reaching for those.

Switching Between Keyboards
---------------------------

I've seen a number of ErgoDox owners complain that they haven't been able to switch back and forth between traditionally laid out keyboards and the ErgoDox. This was something that almost prevented me from buying the parts in the first place. But I'm happy to report that I haven't had any troubles at all. I can type at a consistent 100+ words per minute on both without having to warm up. So don't think you'll have to throw out all of your other keyboards after you get your own ErgoDox.

Should You Buy One?
-------------------

Yes (assuming you have the time and money to spare).
