My fiancÃ© has always wanted a dog. Unfortunately there have always been a couple hurdles in their way: (1) I'm allergic to dogs, and (2) we live in a 1 bedroom apartment together.

Well one of these hurdles was jumped over just a few months ago! And maybe not the one you expectâ€¦ I went to the allergist and they told me I'm no longer allergic to dogs ðŸ˜ƒ.

Figuring out how to ensure a dog would get adequate exercise despite our lack of yard wasn't too challenging. So, meet Pigby:
