    A short blog post on a very useful part of my workflow that you should try out. It's a follow up to a recent blog post on keeping a "coding journal".

`Sometimes <https://github.com/galah-group/galah/issues/393>`_ `I <https://github.com/brownhead/phial/issues/1>`_ `talk <https://github.com/brownhead/mangoengine/issues/7>`_ `to <https://github.com/brownhead/superzippy/issues/11>`_ `myself <https://github.com/brownhead/mangoengine/issues/2>`_ `on <https://github.com/galah-group/galah/issues/399>`_ `GitHub <https://github.com/acm-ucr/hub/issues/8>`_. Partially because I'm crazy, but mostly because I like to keep a public record of my thoughts. I use GitHub's issue tracker as a "coding journal".

These journals are awesome in general. A `blog post <http://tburette.github.io/blog/2014/06/25/the-power-of-keeping-a-coding-journal/>`_ that got some attention recently says as much. But they're significantly more awesome if you keep them public because:

* Your users can see your progress on things without more formal communications.
* Coworkers (and future you) can find out why you made certain decisions.
* Mentors and supervisors can know when you're stuck and if they can help you.
* All this communication happens without anyone having to bother you.

I generally begin a task by making a large "brain dump" of everything that comes to mind. As I'm working I'll start writing another comment and then revise and add to it as needed. I'll post the comment when there is a lull or interruption (coffee usually), then start a new one.

This has been my workflow for 2+ years, and when I started working at `Khan Academy <https://www.khanacademy.org/careers>`_ I brought this workflow with me. Initially I was afraid that the storm of monologues would be annoying to my coworkers, but this has definitely not been the case.

At Mozilla however, it didn't seem appropriate to use this workflow. A typical bugzilla issue will have a very large CC list, many of whom I don't know. To compensate, I created a `Trello board <https://trello.com>`_ instead. I shared the board with my mentor and coworkers and it worked quite well.

Try this workflow out on your next personal project. If you like it, try it at work as well.
